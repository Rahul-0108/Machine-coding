Explanation:
For Javelin in 2019:
There are two teams: "Mumbai Indians" and "Gujarat Titans".
Each team gets 0.5 rupees (since the total is 1 rupee).
"Mumbai Indians" has one winner, James Peebles, who gets the entire 0.5 rupees.
"Gujarat Titans" has two winners, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who split the team's 0.5 rupees equally, receiving 0.25 rupees each.
